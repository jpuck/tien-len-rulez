## Coming Roctober 2020 üçª

It was authoritatively decreed at `2020-08-29T05:57:00-05:00` that 1.5 pounds of hops shall burst from 10 gallons.
Immediately, forces of good were dispatched to convene ingredients for a work of love converging on Saturday, Septembeer 5<sup>th</sup> which will henceforth always be remembeered as **Labor Day**.

## Happy Yeast

On or around 12:00 Z, Septembeer 6th, great gaseous clouds were noted issuing forth from the fermenter blowoff tube, placing the upper bound on fermentation lag time at 15 hours. As of this writing (T+45 hours since pitch) the summated yeast belches are a near constant rolling gurgle. To step inside the brew shed is to dive into a miasmal space of caramel vapor and hop gas.

## Behold the Knowledge

What follows is a glimpse into the past and visions of a possible future:

## We Bought the Ticket, Now Finish the Ride

The prototype reflectix wrap is helping the cold water loop keep all passengers at a comfortable 68.0F, approximately 13 degrees below ambient, and dead-on the temp setpoint

![right on the money, baby](./beer/right-on-the-money.jpg)

Temps are nice and stable. The blue line shows when the cold water pump was running. It turned off about an hour before this screenshot:

![stability, serenity](./beer/stable-temps.jpg)

ABV should fall in the 6.0-6.5% range.

TBD: 
* Check SG daily when airlock activity slows, probably starting on 9/10 or 9/11
* After 2 identical SG readings dump yeast cake
* Dry hop with the sweet resin cryo pellets
